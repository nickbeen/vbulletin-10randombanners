# 10 Random Banners

**Note:** This product is not limited to 10 random banners since it drives on HTML. You can tune it to showing 10 defined YouTube video's which will be displayed randomly. It's up to you.

**Description**  
This lightweight product allows you to place $tenrandombanners on your template(s), which will randomly pick one of the 10 admin-defined banners. Every refresh of the page gives you another banner, unless the same banner is randomly chosen again.
Setting the banners (or any other object you want to display) is completely done with HTML (and not with millions of settings), so you can have full control over the height, width, alt, target, etc. per banner. You could use any other kind of HTML or conditional statements (if usergroup, if forum, if script, etc.) too.
